-------CHANGING IP ADDRESS OF THE RASPBERRY PI---------------
(1) Open the command window of the Raspberry Pi, edit the DHCP client configuration
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

(2) Add a static IP at the end
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.30/24 (enter the preferred IP address)
static routers=192.168.1.1 (adjust the gateway if it is different)
 
(3) Save and exit by pressing in the following order
CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X

(4) Open the command window of the Raspberry Pi and restart the network
sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd

or simply reboot by typing: sudo reboot

CHECK IF THE IP ADDRESS OF THE RASPBERRY PI HAS CHANGED

******IF NOT******
(1) Open the command window of the Raspberry Pi and first ensure that the dhcpcd is running 
systemctl status dhcpcd

(2) If it is not active, we need to enable it:
sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
sudo systemctl start dhcpcd

(3) Make sure that Network Manager is not overriding it
nmcli device show

if the interface (eth0 or wlan0) is shown, then the Network Manager is managing the network and the following would have to be set

For ethernet (eth0), use:
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.30/24
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dns 192.168.1.1
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method manual
nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"

--------LOGGING IN TO THE RASPBERRY PI---------

Open Windows Powershell and make a secure login using the IP address of the Raspberry Pi (192.168.1.30)
ssh enpro@192.168.1.30
Enter the password of the Raspberry Pi (obtain it from Mathias)
If password is not known, a complete reset of the the Raspberry Pi is required. But then reinstallation of different softwares and packages will be necessary.

Install Real VNCViewer on the Computer/ Laptop/ Smartphone
Enter the IP Address of the Raspberry Pi and give permission for access to the Raspberry Pi
Browse through the files of the Raspberry Pi

--------SETTING UP THE RASPBERRY PI CAMERA---------
Open the Terminal of the Raspberry Pi
Enter the following code: libcamera-hello --timeout 10000000
This will prompt the camera to show a live window. 
The user can then adjust the focus of the camera using this live window.
